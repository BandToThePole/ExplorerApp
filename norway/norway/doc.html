        <h1>Connection</h1>
        <p>This app supports connecting to multiple Microsoft Bands, although
            only a single Band can be used at once. After firstly ensuring that
            the Band is paired with your iPhone you will then see the Band
            listed on the <strong>Connection</strong> tab. Tap on a Band to
            connect to it. Once a Band has been connected to a checkmark will
            show next to its name.</p>
        <p>The app will automatically connect to the most recently connected to
            Band when it is first launched.</p>
        <h1>Recording</h1>
        <p>After a connection to a Band has been established you can begin a
            <strong>recording session</strong>, which is a short period for
            which sensor data is collected from the Band and stored on your
            iPhone - it won't yet be transmitted anywhere. It is important to
            ensure that you manually stop a recording session within the app
            before you attempt to sync sessions.</p>
        <h1>Sessions</h1>
        <p>All recorded sessions data can be accessed from within the app, with
            visual indicators to show whether the data has been synced to the
            cloud.</p>
        <h1>Sending</h1>
        <p>Firstly, you will need an account on the Band to the Pole web server.
            When you first login it will verify that your account details are
            correct, so it is important to have an Internet connection when you
            first do this. There are three sync options:</P>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Email:</strong> all recorded session data is compressed
                and attached to an email.</li>
            <li><strong>Sync new:</strong> attempts to sync all previously
                unsynced sessions. If the sync doesn't succeed the sessions
                won't be marked as synced, and they can be synced in the future
                instead.</li>
            <li><strong>Sync all:</strong> does the same as 'Sync new', but
                sends all data (the server handles duplicates).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The data from a single recording session will generally be on the
            order of a few hundred bytes, which is way under the size of a
            single TCP/IP packet.</p>
